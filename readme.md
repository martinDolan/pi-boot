# PI Boot

A SASS + Bootstrap framework for common use. Currently under development.

Remaining TODOS:

- Build JS asset flow to concatenate scripts (remove bootstrap-all.js and bundle scripts as modules)
- Develop shared components for features not covered in Bootstrap
- Concatenate bootstrap mixins (seems a waste to be that modular)
- ???
- PROFIT

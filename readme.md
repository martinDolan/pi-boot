# PI Boot + Gulp

Test build using Gulp as a front-end layer.

Currently only compiles SASS.

### To install:

Install gulp (assuming you have node installed):

    npm install --global gulp

Install gulp into the project, and all it's dependencies:

    npm install gulp-ruby-sass --save-dev

Then run grunt as normal:

    grunt watch

### Current Tasks:

- sass (compiles sass)
- watch (watches sass/\*.scss for changes, then compiles sass)

### To Do:

- js concat
- js minification
- build process
